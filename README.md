This repository contains resources (consumed as reference) in the talk on Island Architecture present at **TILConf 2024**. The presentation discusses the challenges posed by JavaScript-heavy web applications and introduces Islands Architecture as a solution to these challenges. It explores the benefits of Islands, how they work, and compares them to Single Page Applications (SPA).
